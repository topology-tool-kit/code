- libraries
. make sure only the paraview plugins build against the VTK shipped with PV and not everything.
  -- to fix first 

- CMake TTK messages
=
. put the cmake ttk messages back in (useful for debug)

- accessible cmake features
=
[.] make ParaView_DIR accessible through cmake config (appears when paraview enabled)
. make VTK_DIR accessible through cmake config
[.] make TTK_PLUGIN_INSTALL_DIR accessible through cmake config
. careful about open mp flag (macro)
. careful about kamikaze, mpi,
[ ] Update the scripts for the paraview split again

- default values: 
=
[.] install everything

- variable namng convention
=
TTK_LIBRARY
TTK_VTK_LIBRARY
TTK_PARAVIEW_PLUGINS
TTK_STANDALONE_APPS

[x] TTK_ENABLE_CPU_OPTIMIZATION
[x] TTK_ENABLE_KAMIKAZE
[x] TTK_ENABLE_MPI
[x] TTK_ENABLE_OPENMP
[x] TTK_ENABLE_FIBER_SURFACE_WITH_RANGE_OCTREE

TTK_INSTALL_PLUGIN_DIR

- paraview plugins
=
[.] move cmake code to the paraview dir

- binaries
=
. move them to an executable location (/usr/local/bin is by default)

- root CMakeLists.txt
=
. list all buildadble components (such that users can simply comment things out)
 > there's pros and cons about that feature (let's see that later)

- third party code
=
. create a TTK_LIBRARIES variable (just like VTK_LIBRARIES) to make the CMakeLists.txt simpler (see my comment on topo-vol commit)

= 
Travis CI support?
